#+TITLE: MySQL Usage, Tips, Tricks & Info

* Setup Related
** New User
: mysql --user=root
: mysql> SELECT User FROM mysql.user; 
For login without password:
: mysql> create user 'Hal'@'localhost';
To make a superuser
: mysql> GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'Hal'@'localhost';


* Checking The Status of Stuff
: mysqladmin extended-status

* Macports installation Specific info
Data location 
: /opt/local/var/db/mysql55/
Default socket location? (this hould be changed/overriden in config file)
: /opt/local/var/run/mysql55/mysqld.sock
Config file
: /opt/local/etc/mysql55/my.cnf
** Extra things you have to do in setup with Macports MySQL
*** Configure MySQL to read/create the sock in the correct location
After a fresh install of MySQL via macports I was getting the error messages: 
: mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
: error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/opt/local/var/run/mysql55/mysqld.sock' (2)'
: Check that mysqld is running and that the socket: '/opt/local/var/run/mysql55/mysqld.sock' exists! 
**** Solution - Edit the MySQL config file my.cnf
I had to edit the file 
: /opt/local/etc/mysql55/my.cnf
to add the line
: [mysqld_safe] socket = /tmp/mysql.sock
after that I could do
: sudo mysql55
and the mySQL server would start ok....


* mysql - using the client CLI
** New Database
: mysql> CREATE DATABASE hunome_development;
Basic usage is 
: mysql --user=user_name --password=your_password db_name
** Troubleshooting
*** Every time i press the character 'e' it starts spewing out "call.inputrc call.inputrc call.inputrc..."
 1. Might be something to do with my new settings from .inputrc file setup on konsole/KDE
 2. Or might be something to do with iTerm2
    1. Happens with terminal also however...
 3. Or might be something to do with me not using the =system-readline= variant of the mysql55 port
**** ANSWER - it was due to having =echo ".inputrc called...= in my .inputrc file

* Troubleshooting
I get:
: mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
: error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/opt/local/var/run/mysql55/mysqld.sock' (2)'
: Check that mysqld is running and that the socket: '/opt/local/var/run/mysql55/mysqld.sock' exists! 
But all i have is 
: /opt/local/var/run/mysql55/.turd_mysql55-server
and
: /opt/local/var/db/mysql55/.turd_mysql55-server

* Using LIKE
Can definitely use it on 'strings' and 'varchars'

Can also use it on "datetime" fields
: select id, start_time from sessions where start_time LIKE '%2012-10-01%';
