#+TITLE: Some OS X specific tips about unix and the shell/command line

 - See [[file:Org-Docs/iTerm.org][iTerm]] for tips on working with the iTerm2 terminal emulator

* Changing user settings - alternative to usermod
In OS X use dscl
** Adding a user to a group
: dscl . append /Groups/the_group_you_want GroupMembership the_user
** Deleting a user from a group
: dscl . delete /Groups/admin GroupMembership usershortname
** Reading the membership of the admin group:
: dscl . read /Groups/admin GroupMembership
* Use lsof instead of netstat:
** When I am logged into hal9000 through ssh this is what lsof shows me
$ sudo lsof -i tcp -nP
ssh       51722      Hal    3u  IPv4 0xffffff8011dd2a40      0t0  TCP 192.168.1.3:64159->203.29.131.142:22 (ESTABLISHED)
ssh       51722      Hal    6u  IPv4 0xffffff8011df1de0      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:9991 (LISTEN)
ssh       51722      Hal    7u  IPv6 0xffffff800b0d7cc0      0t0  TCP [::1]:9991 (LISTEN)

So we have a local port on 9991 which is the dynamic forwarding that enables FoxyProxy to work.
And the remote machine:
203.29.131.142:22
is connecting to my machine, HAL9000 on
192.168.1.3:64159
as we told it to do in the ssh config

Lets check:
$ host office.catalyst-au.net
office.catalyst-au.net is an alias for koshka.catalyst-au.net.
koshka.catalyst-au.net has address 203.29.131.142

* FoxyProxy
** Security Certificates and Not being able to add exceptions
You need to enable the FoxyProxy proxy setting for all sites to get this to work
 - otherwise the certificate will not be sent through the proxy and we cant get it.

* Git cloning from my remote machine
$ git clone ssh://hal9000/home/hal/rails-sis hurricane
* scp from my remote machine
$ scp hal9000:~/password.txt.gpg .

* Document Sharing
 - You can make a file/folder shared in OS X by making it *both* readable and executable for =others=
: chmod o+x Documents/
: chmod o+r Documents/
* The output of bind -V and the Meta/Super Key
# output of iTerm2
# $ bind -V | grep meta
# convert-meta is set to `off'
# enable-meta-key is set to `on'
# input-meta is set to `on'
# meta-flag is set to `on'
# output-meta is set to `on'

# output of Terminal
# bind -V|grep meta
# convert-meta is set to `on'
# enable-meta-key is set to `on'
# input-meta is set to `off'
# meta-flag is set to `off'
# output-meta is set to `off' 

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# OTHER INFO
# don't strip characters to 7 bits when reading
# set input-meta on

# allow iso-latin1 characters to be inserted rather
# than converted to prefix-meta sequences
# set convert-meta off

# display characters with the eighth bit set directly
# rather than as meta-prefixed characters
# set output-meta on
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* DNS
** This will tell you the order of DNS are called from first resolver onwards
: scutil --dns
** Getting around the fact that apparently OS X 10.7+ does not resolve DNS servers in the expected order
I setup dnsmasq
: sudo port install dnsmasq
and start with
: sudo port load dnsmasq
Set the DNS to
: 127.0.0.1 
in 
: System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced Settings -> DNS -> DNS Servers
and config file
* Problems with hosts as set in =/etc/hosts= not resolving
See [[http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/2011/07/27/mac-os-x-lion-etc-hosts-bugs-and-dns-resolution/]]
** Solution
*** Install DNSMasq?
: sudo port install dnsmasq
Then copy resolv.conf
: sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf ~/resolv.dnsmasq.conf
Then edit =/opt/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf= to set
: resolv-file=/etc/resolv.dnsmasq.conf
Then start dnsmasq with 
: sudo port load dnsmasq
and add localhost to the list of DNS servers via 
: System Preferences > Network > (Select Connection, i.e. Wi-Fi) > Advanced > DNS
and add 127.0.0.1
Now i think you can add entries to your =/opt/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf= file like this:
: address=/.local/127.0.0.1
or is it
: server=/hunomeOnApache/127.0.0.1
