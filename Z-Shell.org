* Oh-My-Shell
Can sequester into its own directory
: git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
and add
: source ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template
to your 
: .zshrc 
or 
: .zshrc_mac
** Customising auto-completion
To enable custom auto-completion etc from "Oh My Shell"
Set the plugins array  
: plugins=(git macports mysql-macports apache2-macports rails3)
in
: "/Users/Hal/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template"

* Choosing a prompt
** Previewing available prompts
: prompt -p
** Listing available prompts
: prompt -l
** Choosing prompt with parameter
Choose fade prompt with red parameter
: prompt fade 'red'

* "Bash Completion"
: typeset -A key
: [[ -n "${key[Up]}"   ]]  && bindkey  "${key[Up]}"    history-beginning-search-backward
: [[ -n "${key[Down]}" ]]  && bindkey  "${key[Down]}"  history-beginning-search-forward

* And xterm
** 'robbyrussell' theme has arrows and suff that dont work by default in xterm
*** Solutions?
* Grep and regular expressions dont seem to work the same
When I ran the 'find-grep' command from emacs it would sometimes exit abnormally.
Bascally whenever i had a character like 
: - _
etc

Whats the deal here? How do we do regexs in Z?

* Calling ssh-add from .zshenv - not a good idea
Thought this would be run once at login but now its asking me for my passphrase even when i try to do stuff like shell commands from emacs
