#+TITLE: My Ideal Coding Environment

Inspired by frusttrations/temptations towards choosing Sublime Text over Emacs


* Pros of Emacs
** Open Source
** Run in terminal and graphical
* Cons of Emacs
** Frequently Buggy
** Sometimes slow
** functional language makes it hard to find available commands
I have a list - what the fuck can i do with it? 
How do i find the command?
* Pros of Sublime Text
* Cons of Sublime Text


* What I want - No bullshit, no legacy, From the Beginning.....
