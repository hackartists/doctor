** TODO Learn Mode creation
** TODO Change Org-Mode Bindings & Add functions
 - want to keep some of the easy alt and shift bindings though
 - make easy =start-unordered-list= binding and =create-source-code-block-on-region= (similar to my comment region|line function)
** TODO Change Outline-Minor-Mode Bindings
 - Make something halfway sensible
 - It doesnt matter so much if it overrides other bindings
   - its a code introspection mode - not code modification
 - probably tie it into org-mode bindings
   - i.e. TAB will show or hide something etc
** TODO Get a Better Multi-Mode
 - minmamo mode sucks
** TODO 
* TODO vim
** Define some reasonably sane sesttings/customisations
 - especially some that are emacs compatible
   - swicth between windows?
     - ~\C-w arrow~ to ~\C ...something... Arrow~ (cant use ~\C \Super Arrow~ as this switches terminal tabs in Konsole)
   - back and forwards in buffers
     - =Tab= & =Shift Tab= to =<Command-<= & =<Command->=
   - get =alt left= and =right= going to =back= and =word= in insert mode
