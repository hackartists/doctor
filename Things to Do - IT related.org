#+TITLE: Things to Do

 - See also [[file:Development%20&%20Apps.org][Ideas for Things to Develop (Apps, gems, tools etc)]]

* TODO emacs
Also see [[file:emacs%20knowledge.org::*TO%20DO][Emacs Knowledge: TO DO]]
** DONE Learn Mode creation
** Org-Mode
** TODO Reorganise my docs
 - split stuff like *git*, *apache* etc out into separate org docs
*** TODO Change Org-Mode Bindings & Add functions
  - want to keep some of the easy alt and shift bindings though
  - make easy =start-unordered-list= binding and =create-source-code-block-on-region= (similar to my comment region|line function)
** TODO Change Outline-Minor-Mode Bindings
 - Make something halfway sensible
 - It doesnt matter so much if it overrides other bindings
   - its a code introspection mode - not code modification
 - probably tie it into org-mode bindings
   - i.e. TAB will show or hide something etc
*** TODO Js2-Mode has the right idea i think
Get rid of the '@' symbol
Show entry
: C-c C-e
Hide Entry
: C-c C-c
Show all
: C-c C-a
Hide all
: C-c C-t
Toggle functions
: C-c C-f
Toggle comments!

** TODO Get a Better Multi-Mode
 - minmamo mode sucks
** TODO Add some filetypes to be automatically opened in a certain mode
*** TODO Particularly I want these to open in ruby-mode 
 - .rake files
 - Gemfile
*** DONE I seem to have great difficulty with .js files and js2-mode :-(
But i'm not sure - still they always seem to open in normal javascript mode despite me adding to 
: auto-mode-alist
Is this because the original file association is still stored first?

Apparently not - i dont get anything for the command
: (rassoc 'javascript-mode auto-mode-alist)
and 
: (assoc "\\.js$" auto-mode-alist)
returns
: ("\\.js$" . js2-mode)
(Same with assq and rassq)

BUT 
: (rassoc 'javascript-generic-mode auto-mode-alist)
gives
: ("\\.js\\'" . javascript-generic-mode)
which i can get rid of with
: (setq auto-mode-alist (delq (rassoc 'javascript-generic-mode auto-mode-alist) auto-mode-alist))
** TODO Make some modes open with certain fonts and with linum-mode etc
*** Source Code Files
 - Fixed width
 - linum-mode
*** Org-Mode and Other Stuff
 - No linum-mode
 - Fancy font?
** TODO Change word boundaries in haml and master word boundaries in general
Want it to recognise CamelCase? (underscores) as separate words...
* TODO vim
** Define some reasonably sane settings/customisations
 - especially some that are emacs compatible
   - swicth between windows?
     - ~\C-w arrow~ to ~\C ...something... Arrow~ (cant use ~\C \Super Arrow~ as this switches terminal tabs in Konsole)
   - back and forwards in buffers
     - =Tab= & =Shift Tab= to =<Command-<= & =<Command->=
   - get =alt left= and =right= going to =back= and =word= in insert mode

** Try Vundle
* TODO linux
** TODO learn cronjobs
** TODO learn about POSIX filesystem/inode stuff 
that Alex/Brendan/Edward were talking about the other night
** TODO get git bash completion going
** TODO Different distro? BSD?
** TODO Learn about how to mount other directories - particularly from a virtual machine
 - This could be very cool in development
 - Could treat the filesystem as a local thing but be running/serving from the other machine
*** With VirtualBox this seems to need virtualbox specific code/configuration
 - You have to install the "Guest Additions" and then do something like:
: sudo mount -t vboxsf blabla /mnt
 - Not sure what blabla is - arbitrary name?
** TODO Learn/Fix shebang thing with env variables
   See [[file:Shell%20Scripting%20Magic.org::*Shebang%20lines%20&%20the%20better%20use%20of%20them][Shebang lines & the better use of them]] for a summary of the issue
* TODO General Dev Tools/Help
** TODO Make some scripts to automate tasks - possibly as a separate repo from standard tools one
Should be in a 
: ~/bin
directory
*** TODO e.g. automate some stuff after doing a git pull in rails
Making a postpull script
* Web Development
** TODO  Learn and Install nginx
* TODO OS X
** TODO Configure dnsmasq properly
** TODO Get some linux features on to a Mac
*** Alt Drag and Alt Resize
   - apparently possible with some plugin
*** "Keep On Top"
*** Check this out - Afloat
 - Seems to do all this stuff:
 - free
 - Not actively maintained however
   - Heard some mixed things about its installation
   - Lion/Mountain Lion support?
http://infinite-labs.net/afloat/

** Get a really good Key / *touchpad* remapper
*** KeyRemap with XML
*** Ukelele
 - free?
http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele
*** ControllerMate
 - $25
http://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/
*** Bit of an aside - xkeys?
Hmmm
http://www.xkeys.com/xkeys.php

*** FunctionFlip - Change some media keys to function keys but not all
    http://kevingessner.com/software/functionflip/
