* *Skeleton App* - A way of quickly navigating and familiarising oneself with a new Rails app
 - Viewing a URL will show
   - the paths of the partials displayed
   - The variable names/models invoked
   - Controller stuff
   - Can we show Javascript stuff?
     - Events?
* Rails Model/SQL Table visualisation
 - Something better than RailRoady
 - Can be restricted to show a subset of models to be more comprehensible
 - Can work from model associations or directly reading tables from a database?

* Emacs/Ruby script - Git pull & update TAGS file and revisit tags file, bundle check/install and rake db:migrate check/migrate...
* Gem to show output of db:migrate:status in browser - like sextant with routes
: bundle exec rake db:migrate:status
* Something like Hyperpolyglot but will show different properties of language
** Scope
e.g. Show the scope rules for Javascript 
: {} does not introduce new scope
vs something else like Ruby
* Some kind of GreaseMonkey Script/CSS i can use to restyle certain pages
e.g. to always run something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC css
#container {
 margin-left: 200px;
}
#+END_SRC
* Rails/Ruby
** TODO Setup irbc so that different history files are created for each environment e.g. test, development etc
