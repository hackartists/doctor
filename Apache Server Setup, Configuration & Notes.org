#+TITLE: Apache Server Setup, Configuration, Tips, Notes & Troubleshooting

* Server/Apache Management on Debian/Ubuntu
** Getting rid of the "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name" error 
Add the following to =/etc/apache2/apache2.conf= 
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
# HAL - trying to get rid of 
# "apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name" error...
ServerName HALserver
#+END_SRC
** Restart the server
$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
OR
$ service apache2 reload
OR
$ apache2ctl restart

other useful stuff maybe:
check and modify which apache modules are available and enabled
$ a2enmod
copies a site from available to enabled directory of apache:
$ a2ensite drupal-cat-au-website.conf  

User name that runs apache etc is set in:
/etc/apache2/envvars

However are we restarting
/etc/init.d/apache2
OR
 /usr/sbin/apache2

** Available/Enabled Sites

I edited the apache2 file:
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default
adding:
    Alias /hal/ "/home/hal/work/"
    <Directory "/home/hal/work/">
        Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128
    </Directory>
so that i can access my /home/hal/work folder at the URL:
http://localhost/hal/

Later we added
a file:
drupal-cat-au-website.conf 
to the directory:
/etc/apache2/sites-available
This specified some site specific error/access logging in a new directory/file
/var/log/sitelogs/drupal-site-cat-au-website/
did:
$ chgrp www-data /var/log/sitelogs/drupal-site-cat-au-website/
$ chmod g+w /var/log/sitelogs/drupal-site-cat-au-website/
$ a2ensite drupal-cat-au-website.conf 

** Hosts file
Also have to add the line:
127.0.0.1 d.catalyst-au.net
to /etc/hosts where d.catalyst-au.net is the SeverName from drupal-cat-au-website.conf 

q

** Apache on Debian uses a Non-Standard Configuration

* Comments in Apache conf files
Either # at beginning and backslash at end of line for multiline comments
#+BEGIN_SRC apache
# Comment goes here\
  and here, and there,\
  and everywhere
#+END_SRC
or just # at beginning of line.
